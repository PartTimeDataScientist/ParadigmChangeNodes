# Introduction
This is the technical documentation for the *ParadigmChange Nodes for KNIME*. The *ParadigmChange Nodes for KNIME* are a somewhat assorted collection of nodes developed by [Lars RÃ¶glin](https://github.com/PartTimeDataScientist/). Origin of the name is running gag between colleagues working at a startup company.

First nodes to be released to the public are the [*Apprise Nodes*](apprise_nodes/index.md) which allow a wide range of notifications reight from your KNIME workflow. Further nodes will follow.
